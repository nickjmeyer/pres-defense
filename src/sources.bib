            Building on the successful applications of Stackelberg
            Security Games (SSGs) to protect infrastructure,
            researchers have begun focusing on applying game theory to
            green security domains such as protection of endangered
            animals and fish stocks. Previous efforts in these domains
            optimize defender strategies based on the standard
            Stackelberg assumption that the adversaries become fully
            aware of the defender's strategy before taking
            action. Unfortunately, this assumption is inappropriate
            since adversaries in green security domains often lack the
            resources to fully track the defender strategy. This paper
            (i) introduces Green Security Games (GSGs), a novel game
            model for green security domains with a generalized
            Stackelberg assumption; (ii) provides algorithms to plan
            effective sequential defender strategies --- such planning
            was absent in previous work; (iii) proposes a novel
            approach to learn adversary models that further improves
            defender performance; and (iv) provides detailed
            experimental analysis of proposed approaches.

 abstract = {<p>We all played tag when we were kids. What most of us don't realize is that this simple chase game is in fact an application of pursuit theory, and that the same principles of games like tag, dodgeball, and hide-and-seek are also at play in military strategy, high-seas chases by the Coast Guard, and even romantic pursuits. In<em>Chases and Escapes</em>, Paul Nahin gives us the first complete history of this fascinating area of mathematics, from its classical analytical beginnings to the present day.</p><p>Drawing on game theory, geometry, linear algebra, target-tracking algorithms, and much more, Nahin also offers an array of challenging puzzles with their historical background and broader applications.<em>Chases and Escapes</em>includes solutions to all problems and provides computer programs that readers can use for their own cutting-edge analysis.</p><p>Now with a gripping new preface on how the Enola Gay escaped the shock wave from the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, this book will appeal to anyone interested in the mathematics that underlie pursuit and evasion.</p>},

title = {Essential information: Uncertainty and optimal control of Ebola outbreaks},
year = {2017},
doi = {10.1073/pnas.1617482114},
abstract ={Early resolution of uncertainty during an epidemic outbreak can lead to rapid and efficient decision making, provided that the uncertainty affects prioritization of actions. The wide range in caseload projections for the 2014 Ebola outbreak caused great concern and debate about the utility of models. By coding and running 37 published Ebola models with five candidate interventions, we found that, despite this large variation in caseload projection, the ranking of management options was relatively consistent. Reducing funeral transmission and reducing community transmission were generally ranked as the two best options. Value of information (VoI) analyses show that caseloads could be reduced by 11% by resolving all model-specific uncertainties, with information about model structure accounting for 82% of this reduction and uncertainty about caseload only accounting for 12%. Our study shows that the uncertainty that is of most interest epidemiologically may not be the same as the uncertainty that is most relevant for management. If the goal is to improve management outcomes, then the focus of study should be to identify and resolve those uncertainties that most hinder the choice of an optimal intervention. Our study further shows that simplifying multiple alternative models into a smaller number of relevant groups (here, with shared structure) could streamline the decision-making process and may allow for a better integration of epidemiological modeling and decision making for policy.},

	abstract = {Controlling Ebola outbreaks and planning an effective response to future emerging diseases are enhanced by understanding the role of geography in transmission. Here we show how epidemic expansion may be predicted by evaluating the relative probability of alternative epidemic paths. We compared multiple candidate models to characterize the spatial network over which the 2013{\textendash}2015 West Africa epidemic of Ebola virus spread and estimate the effects of geographical covariates on transmission during peak spread. The best model was a generalized gravity model where the probability of transmission between locations depended on distance, population density and international border closures between Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and neighbouring countries. This model out-performed alternative models based on diffusive spread, the force of infection, mobility estimated from cell phone records and other hypothesized patterns of spread. These findings highlight the importance of integrated geography to epidemic expansion and may contribute to identifying both the most vulnerable unaffected areas and locations of maximum intervention value.},
