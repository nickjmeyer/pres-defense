            Building on the successful applications of Stackelberg
            Security Games (SSGs) to protect infrastructure,
            researchers have begun focusing on applying game theory to
            green security domains such as protection of endangered
            animals and fish stocks. Previous efforts in these domains
            optimize defender strategies based on the standard
            Stackelberg assumption that the adversaries become fully
            aware of the defender's strategy before taking
            action. Unfortunately, this assumption is inappropriate
            since adversaries in green security domains often lack the
            resources to fully track the defender strategy. This paper
            (i) introduces Green Security Games (GSGs), a novel game
            model for green security domains with a generalized
            Stackelberg assumption; (ii) provides algorithms to plan
            effective sequential defender strategies --- such planning
            was absent in previous work; (iii) proposes a novel
            approach to learn adversary models that further improves
            defender performance; and (iv) provides detailed
            experimental analysis of proposed approaches.

 abstract = {<p>We all played tag when we were kids. What most of us don't realize is that this simple chase game is in fact an application of pursuit theory, and that the same principles of games like tag, dodgeball, and hide-and-seek are also at play in military strategy, high-seas chases by the Coast Guard, and even romantic pursuits. In<em>Chases and Escapes</em>, Paul Nahin gives us the first complete history of this fascinating area of mathematics, from its classical analytical beginnings to the present day.</p><p>Drawing on game theory, geometry, linear algebra, target-tracking algorithms, and much more, Nahin also offers an array of challenging puzzles with their historical background and broader applications.<em>Chases and Escapes</em>includes solutions to all problems and provides computer programs that readers can use for their own cutting-edge analysis.</p><p>Now with a gripping new preface on how the Enola Gay escaped the shock wave from the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, this book will appeal to anyone interested in the mathematics that underlie pursuit and evasion.</p>},
